							<h3>Kickstarter</h3>
							<p>The funding goal is the amount of money that a creator needs to complete their project. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing. No one will be charged for a pledge towards a project unless it reaches its funding goal.
                            Everything on Kickstarter must be a project with a clear goal,from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative ideas that are brought to life through the direct support of others.<br /> Everything needs to have end product like making an album, a book, or a work of art. A project will eventually be completed, and something will be produced by it.</p>
